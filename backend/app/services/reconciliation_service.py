    #   Given a list of numbers, find combinations that add up to a target value.

    #   correction amount the operator needs to re-enter into the POS system.
    #
    # Algorithm: recursive backtracking
    #   Build a combination one product at a time.
    #   At each step, try adding each product to the current combination.
    #   If the running total exceeds target_amount, stop that path and backtrack.
    #   If the running total equals target_amount, save the combination.

    # Why search by item count (1 item, then 2, then 3...)?
    #   This guarantees shorter combinations are always returned first.
